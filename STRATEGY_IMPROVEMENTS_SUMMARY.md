## 🔧 Key Risk Management Improvements

### Position Sizing
- **Current Issue**: Fixed sizing regardless of conditions
- **Solution**: Dynamic sizing based on volatility and regime
- **Implementation**: 1-2% risk per trade, scale based on market conditions

### Stop Loss Management
- **Current Issue**: Static stops not adapted to market structure
- **Solution**: Volume Profile-based dynamic stops
- **Implementation**: Use VP levels (VAL/VAH) as natural stops with 0.2% buffer

### Profit Taking
- **Current Issue**: Binary exit approach hurts win rate
- **Solution**: Staged profit taking strategy
- **Implementation**: 
  - 30-40% profits at 2% gain
  - 30-40% more at 3.5% gain
  - Let remaining position run to major targets

### Market Regime Adaptation
- **Current Issue**: Same strategy regardless of conditions
- **Solution**: Regime-specific parameter adjustments
- **Implementation**:
  - Bear markets: Mean reversion, tight stops, quick profits
  - Bull markets: Trend following, wider stops, larger targets
  - Ranging markets: Support/resistance plays, neutral bias
