# Paper Trading System Feature Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to extend the existing BTC Research Engine with paper trading capabilities. The goal is to enable "click and run" paper trading of strategies that have been backtested successfully, with minimal changes to the existing codebase.

## User Requirements

### Primary Goals
- **One-click deployment**: "Click run" to start paper trading a strategy
- **Real-time execution**: Paper trade using live market data
- **Strategy management**: Add/remove strategies without system restart
- **API access**: Fetch stats for frontend development
- **Trade visualization**: See entry/exit points on charts
- **Docker deployment**: Containerized setup for easy management

### Secondary Goals
- **Frontend dashboard**: Basic web interface for monitoring
- **TradingView integration**: Professional charting (future)
- **Multi-strategy support**: Run multiple strategies simultaneously
- **Performance tracking**: Real-time P&L and statistics

## Current System Analysis

### Strengths (Reusable Components)
- **YAML-driven strategies**: Configuration approach works for live trading
- **Multi-timeframe engine**: Ready for real-time data adaptation
- **Indicator framework**: Modular system easily extends to streaming data
- **Risk management**: Position sizing and equity protection already implemented
- **Performance metrics**: Comprehensive backtesting statistics

### Gaps (Components to Build)
- **Real-time data streaming**: WebSocket connections to exchanges
- **Paper trading engine**: Simulated order execution and position tracking
- **API layer**: REST endpoints for strategy management and statistics
- **Web interface**: Dashboard for monitoring and control
- **Persistence**: Trade history and position storage

## Architecture Overview

### Core Design Principles
1. **Minimal core changes**: Preserve existing backtesting framework
2. **Configuration reuse**: Same YAML files for backtest and paper trading
3. **Modular extension**: New functionality in separate `live/` package
4. **Docker-first**: Containerized deployment from the start
5. **API-driven**: Clean separation between engine and interface

### System Components

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- **StreamManager**: Real-time market data via WebSocket
- **PaperTrader**: Simulated order execution with realistic fills
- **Portfolio**: Position and P&L tracking
- **StrategyRunner**: Real-time strategy execution orchestrator

#### Phase 2: API & Management
- **FastAPI Server**: REST API for strategy lifecycle management
- **Strategy Manager**: Start/stop/monitor running strategies
- **Statistics API**: Real-time performance metrics
- **Trade History API**: Entry/exit records with timestamps

#### Phase 3: Deployment & Monitoring
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-service deployment setup
- **Flask Dashboard**: Simple web interface for monitoring
- **Redis Cache**: Real-time data buffering
- **PostgreSQL**: Trade and position persistence (optional for MVP)

## Technical Requirements

### Data Requirements
- **Exchange**: Binance US (consistent with current backtesting)
- **Timeframes**: 1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h (matching existing strategy needs)
- **Symbols**: BTC/USDT, BTC/USDC (expandable)
- **Latency**: Sub-second data updates for responsive trading

### Performance Requirements
- **Data processing**: <200ms indicator calculations (matching current requirement)
- **Order simulation**: Realistic fills with commission/slippage
- **API response**: <100ms for status/statistics endpoints
- **Concurrent strategies**: Support 5+ simultaneous strategies

### Storage Requirements
- **Trade history**: Permanent storage of all simulated trades
- **Position tracking**: Real-time portfolio state
- **Performance metrics**: Historical P&L and statistics
- **Configuration**: Strategy YAML files and runtime parameters

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope
1. **Single strategy support**: Start with volume-profile-breakout.yaml
2. **Basic API**: Start/stop/status/stats endpoints
3. **Simple dashboard**: HTML/JS interface for monitoring
4. **Docker setup**: Single-command deployment
5. **Manual testing**: Verify accuracy against backtesting results

### Post-MVP Extensions
1. **Multiple strategies**: Concurrent execution support
2. **Advanced dashboard**: Charts with trade markers
3. **TradingView integration**: Professional charting interface
4. **Strategy optimization**: Live parameter tuning
5. **Alert system**: Email/Slack notifications for trades

## Risk Considerations

### Technical Risks
- **Data reliability**: WebSocket connection stability
- **Indicator accuracy**: Real-time vs backtest result consistency
- **Resource usage**: Memory/CPU requirements for continuous operation
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation when market data is unavailable

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Fallback mechanisms**: REST API data when WebSocket fails
- **Validation testing**: Compare live calculations with backtest results
- **Resource monitoring**: Docker resource limits and health checks
- **Comprehensive logging**: Debug information for troubleshooting

## Success Criteria

### MVP Success Metrics
- [ ] Deploy paper trading system with single strategy in <30 minutes
- [ ] Real-time strategy execution matches backtest logic 100%
- [ ] API responses within performance requirements
- [ ] System runs continuously for 24+ hours without intervention
- [ ] Trade accuracy verified against manual calculations

### Long-term Success Metrics
- [ ] Support 5+ concurrent strategies without performance degradation
- [ ] Frontend dashboard provides actionable insights
- [ ] System uptime >99% over monthly periods
- [ ] Easy addition of new strategies without code changes
- [ ] Transition to live trading requires minimal modifications

## Next Steps

1. **Create implementation documentation**: Technical details and architecture decisions
2. **Set up progress tracking**: Milestone-based development approach
3. **Begin core infrastructure**: StreamManager and PaperTrader implementation
4. **Validate against backtest**: Ensure consistency with existing results
5. **Build API layer**: REST endpoints for strategy management
6. **Deploy MVP**: Docker Compose setup with basic monitoring

## Notes

- **Framework choice**: Flask preferred over React/Vue for simplicity
- **Database approach**: Start with JSON files, add PostgreSQL if needed
- **Chart integration**: Basic matplotlib/plotly for MVP, TradingView later
- **Strategy isolation**: Single process with async for MVP, separate processes later
- **Exchange selection**: Stick with Binance US for consistency
