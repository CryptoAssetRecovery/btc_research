## Notes & Decisions

### 2025-07-24 - Planning Phase
- **Decision**: Use Flask instead of React/Vue for frontend (simplicity preference)
- **Decision**: FastAPI for REST API (performance and documentation benefits)
- **Decision**: Start with JSON file storage, migrate to PostgreSQL if needed
- **Decision**: Single process with async for MVP, separate processes later
- **Architecture**: Minimal changes to core engine, new functionality in `live/` package

---

## Next Actions

1. **Review documentation** with stakeholder for approval
2. **Begin Phase 1** implementation starting with package structure
3. **Set up development environment** with Docker Compose
4. **Implement StreamManager** as first component
5. **Update this progress document** as work proceeds
